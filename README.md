# digital_von_neumann_automata
The repository contains a LogicWork circuit implementing a 10x10 network of programmable Von Neumann automata

Repository structure:
- "Animazione" contains the network behaviour depicted as an animation. Each pixel represents the state of a single automaton, which can be either on or off
- "Cicuiti logic works" contains the LogicWorks circuit file
- "Dati" contains the raw output of the circuit
- "Programma" contains the code that formats the output in a way that makes it readable by gnuplot (so that one may produce the animated gif mentioned above)
- "Presentazione elettronica" is a presentation, in Italian, on the project
